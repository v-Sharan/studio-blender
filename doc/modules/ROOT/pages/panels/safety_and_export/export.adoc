Once you are finished with your drone show, use the Export panel to export it from Blender to different formats for further processing or direct upload to the drones.

== Show type

Please specify whether you designed a show for outdoor or indoor settings. This will help setup exporters adaptively.

== Export to .skyc

The Skybrush compiled show format is a single-file descriptor of your complete drone show. It is used as the primary drone show format throughout the entire *Skybrush* suite:

* If you wish to visualize or verify your show or you simply want to send a link with an interactive 3D visualization of the show to your clients, use *Skybrush Viewer*.

* If you want to execute your drone show on your real drones, use *Skybrush Live*.

If you press the btn:[Export to .skyc] button, you have to choose the path and filename of your output file. There are also some parameters you can setup conveniently:

Export selected drones only:: Export all or only selected drones

Frame range:: Define the frame range of the output (Storyboard / Render / Preview / Current formation or transition)

Trajectory FPS:: Set output frame rate for drone trajectories (make sure it is a submultiple of your render FPS)

Light FPS:: Set the output frame rate for light programs (make sure it is a submultiple of your render FPS)

Export yaw:: Enable this checkbox to output rotations around the yaw (vertical) axis of your drone objects into the .skyc file

== Export to .csv

The trajectories and LED light colors of the drones can also be sampled at regular intervals and exported to CSV files for further post-processing in external tools. This option appears only if you have installed and enabled the CSV export addon that is distributed separately. The CSV export will produce a single ZIP file that contains multiple CSV files, one for each drone, with the following columns: time (milliseconds), X, Y and Z coordinates (meters) and the red, green and blue components of the color of the LED light, in the usual 0-255 range.

TIP: We recommend using Skybrush Live for drone show control, together with the official Skybrush Compiled Format (.skyc), as it contains a lot more information about your show in a more optimized way than this simple CSV representation.

If you press the btn:[Export to .skyc] button, you have to choose the path and filename of your output file. There are also some parameters you can setup conveniently:

Export selected drones only:: Export all or only selected drones

Frame range:: Define the frame range of the output (Storyboard / Render / Preview / Current formation or transition)

Frame rate:: Set output frame rate of drone trajectories and light programs (make sure it is a submultiple of your render FPS)

NOTE: Special characters in drone names are converted to standard characters in the exported filenames.


== Export to validation .pdf

The btn:[Export to validation .pdf] button creates a unique safety report of your show in .pdf format for standalone self-checking, validated reporting or as a supplement for flight permissions or other administration purposes.

The validation report starts with a summary of flight statistics and safety test results, and continues with detailed plots on all aspects of the implemented safety checks.

.IMPORTANT
****
The validation .pdf is created by a local or remote instance of *Skybrush Studio Server* running in the background. As creating the validation report is resource intensive, access to this feature might be disabled on our public server and might be only available through a paid license option. If you need but do not have access, mailto:support@collmot.com[contact us] for obtaining the proper *Skybrush Studio Server* licence.

Plot positions:: Include position-related plots in the safety report

Plot velocities:: Include velocity-related plots in the safety report

Plot nearest neighbor:: Include a unified nearest neighbor plot in the safety report

Plot all nearest neighbors:: Include nearest neighbor curves on a per-drone basis on a separate page of the safety report.

WARNING: Creating this plot might take a longer time, depending on the number of drones, frames and output frame rate.

Create individual drone plots:: Include validation plots for each drone individually on separate pages in the final output.
